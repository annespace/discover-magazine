        <h2>Who Built the Egyptian Pyramids? Not Slaves</h2>
        <h3>
          Pyramid workers were paid locals. Yet historical narratives and
          Hollywood films have made many believe the Jews built the pyramids
          while enslaved in Egypt.

      <p>
        There’s no end to conspiracy theories about who built the pyramids.
        Frequently they involve ancient aliens, lizard people, the Freemasons,
        or an advanced civilization that used forgotten technology. Scientists
        have tried and failed to combat these baseless ideas. But there is
        another misconception about pyramid construction that’s plagued Egyptian
        scholars for centuries: Slaves did not build the pyramids.
      </p>
      <p>
        The best evidence suggests that pyramid workers were locals who were
        paid for their services and ate extremely well. We know this because
        archaeologists have found their tombs and other signs of the lives they
        lived.
      </p>
      <h4>The Lives of Pyramid Workers</h4>
      <p>
        In 1990, a number of humble gravesites for pyramid workers were found a
        surprisingly short distance from the tombs of the pharaohs. Inside,
        archaeologists discovered all the necessary goods that pyramid workers
        would need to navigate passage to the afterlife — basic kindnesses
        unlikely to have been afforded common slaves.
      </p>
      <p>
        But that’s not all. Archaeologists have also spent years excavating a
        sprawling complex thought to have been a part-time home for thousands of
        workers. The site is called Heit el-Ghurab, and it was also likely part
        of a larger port city along the Nile River where food and supplies for
        the pyramid workers, as well as pyramid construction materials, were
        imported from across the region. Inside the rubble of Heit el-Ghurab,
        they found evidence for large barracks where as many as 1,600 or more
        workers could have slept together. And archaeologists also uncovered
        extensive remains from the many meals they ate, including abundant bread
        and huge quantities of meat, like cattle, goat, sheep and fish.
      </p>
      <p>
        These workers’ graffiti can also be found all over the buildings they
        created. The marks, written in Egyptian, were hidden on blocks inside
        the pyramids and were never meant to be seen. They record the names of
        various work gangs, including “the Drunkards of Menkaure” and “the
        Followers of the Powerful White Crown of Khufu.” (Both gangs were named
        after the respective pharaohs of their day.) Other marks signify towns
        and regions in Egypt. A few seem to function as mascots that represent a
        division of workers, and they feature images of animals such as ibises.
      </p>
      <p>
        Together, these hieroglyphics give archaeologists hints about where the
        workers came from, what their lives were like, and who they worked for.
        Nowhere have archaeologists found signs of slavery or foreign workers.
        Meanwhile, there is ample evidence of labor tax collection throughout
        ancient Egypt. That’s led some researchers to suggest workers might have
        rotated through tours of construction, like a form of national service.
        However, it’s also unclear if that means the workers were coerced.
      </p>
      <h4>Hollywood Myths of Egypt</h4>
      <p>
        So why do so many people think the Egyptian pyramids were built by
        slaves?
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The Greek historian Herodotus seems to have been the first to suggest
          that was the case.
        </li>
        <li>
          Another obvious origin of the slave idea comes from the longstanding
          Judeo-Christian narrative that the Jews were enslaved in Egypt, as
          conveyed by the story of Moses in the book of Exodus.
        </li>
        <li>Hollywood took the idea and ran with it.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        it is easy to throw out this basic misconception. The pyramids were
        built by Egyptians.
